# Example Support Ticket Dataset

This repository includes a **synthetic example dataset** designed to demonstrate the structure and format used in my project.

>  **Note:** This dataset is **not real** â€” it has been generated and anonymized to protect confidentiality and make it suitable for open demonstration.

##  Purpose

The goal of this dataset is to:
- Illustrate the typical fields used in internal helpdesk tickets
- Provide a reference format for AI-based classification or vector search
- Showcasing the dataset used in the project without exposing real user data

The original dataset consisted of **Dutch-language support tickets** from a real helpdesk system. For broader accessibility, this example has been translated into **English**, and sensitive data has been removed or synthesized.
