# Ticket Intelligence Notebooks

This repository contains two Jupyter notebooks that demonstrate classification and clustering techniques applied to IT support tickets.

## Notebooks Overview

### 1. `ticket_classification.ipynb`
Classifies support tickets into predefined issue types using both traditional and transformer-based methods.

Included Models:
- Logistic Regression (TF-IDF features)
- XLM-RoBERTa (fine-tuned transformer)

Visualizations and Metrics:
- ROC and Precision-Recall curves
- Feature importance bar charts
- Calibration curves
- Confusion matrices
- Word clouds and misclassification examples

### 2. `ticket_clustering.ipynb`
Applies unsupervised clustering on ticket descriptions to explore potential grouping patterns.

Clustering Techniques:
- K-Means
- Agglomerative Clustering

Vector Representations:
- TF-IDF (sparse lexical features)
- MiniLM Embeddings (semantic vectors)

Evaluations and Visuals:
- Silhouette plots
- UMAP and PCA projections
- Word clouds
- Intrinsic metrics (Silhouette, Calinski-Harabasz, Davies-Bouldin)
- External metrics (ARI, Purity, Hungarian-aligned classification report)

## Environment

These notebooks are developed for:
- Python 3.8
- Azure ML (or any Jupyter-compatible environment)

### Required Packages

Install all dependencies via:

```bash
pip install pandas numpy matplotlib seaborn scikit-learn umap-learn sentence-transformers
